Principal component analysis with MATLAB

step 1 : Given data input, X  with 1000 samples and dimension of 500 and
         we are to transform the data to m PCA, 

step 2: compute mean of X, Xmean

step 3: compute X_diff, X-Xmean

step 4: compute covariance of diff, covmatrix = cov(diff)

step 5: compute eigen vectors and eigen matrix

step 6: Extract the diagonal of the eigen matrix

step 7: Sort the eigen matrix based base on the diagonal values 
         and extract the top m matrix

step 8: We compute new matrix as follows: X_pca = X_diff*selected_vector
   X_pca is the transformed principal component analysis(PCA)
